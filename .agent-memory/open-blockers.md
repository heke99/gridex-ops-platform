1. No production Supabase project is visible; production migration parity is unverified and production promotion is blocked.
2. Authenticated resolver/end-to-end smoke and k6 execution require the hosted preview plus the configured scoped test credentials.
3. Auth uses an absolute 10-connection allocation; production-project capacity configuration is unverified.
4. Production load testing remains forbidden; smoke/load/spike/ETag/soak are staging/preview only.
