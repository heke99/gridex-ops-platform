# Session log

## 2026-07-25

- Read the master requirements and required repository context.
- Installed permanent project memory and Cursor operating rules.
- Compared local API/docs with the live developer page.
- Implemented all enumerated P0 and P1 repository fixes.
- Added forward-only billing/supply activation migration and manifest checksum.
- Added resolver, public DTO, invoice, interval, cron, activation, quote-schema
  and switch-state regressions.
- Fixed anonymous auth logging so tenantless 401 requests do not wait on the
  integration database.
- Verified typecheck, 346 tests, API docs/parity, migration history, lint and
  production build.
- Confirmed database apply verification is blocked by the absent Supabase
  runtime; recorded the exact staging continuation.

## 2026-07-26

- Traced contract deletion, tenant governance and integration API access across
  database, server actions, UI, tests and documentation.
- Added terminal contract closure and canonical tenant lifecycle RPCs in one
  append-only migration with a registered checksum.
- Added structured tenant activation blockers, close preconditions and
  tenant-status enforcement for API clients.
- Removed competing direct company-status mutation paths.
- Synchronized the admin UI, API docs, OpenAPI files and delivery guide.
- Verified typecheck, 354 tests, API docs/parity, migration history, dedicated
  lifecycle regression, lint and production build.
- Recorded that database application and transactional staging tests remain
  blocked by the absent Supabase/PostgreSQL environment.
- Reproduced the final-function overwrite behind SQLSTATE `42702` and mapped
  the missing backfill, quote, portfolio and FK delete dependencies.
- Added the forward-only canonical contract deletion graph completion.
- Restricted delete/bulk semantics, removed legacy canonicalization-on-delete,
  qualified all final `valid_to` updates and made close null-safe.
- Added terminal list filters, server-side pagination, exact blocker display,
  bulk item summaries and durable bulk error references.
- Verified 302 migrations/207 groups, PostgreSQL parsing, typecheck, 354 tests,
  targeted lifecycle regressions, lint with 0 errors and production build.
- Repaired the final tenant lifecycle `valid_to` definition with a new
  append-only migration and ended paused channels on tenant closure.
- Revoked direct authenticated delete-preview execution and aligned the DB
  lifecycle test with draft/ready-only permanent deletion.
- Added company-scoped contract navigation, three distinct contract counts and
  cross-surface revalidation.
- Aligned API auth error codes and resolver capability gating across runtime
  documentation, OpenAPI and the external integration guide.
- Verified 303 migrations/208 groups, typecheck, 354 tests, API docs, targeted
  regressions, lint with 0 errors and production build.

## 2026-07-27

- Isolated the contract list from readiness/delete graph failures and added
  explicit error/empty states plus strict tenant selection.
- Centralized platform role normalization in TypeScript and PostgreSQL.
- Enforced legal-identity-only matching and verified portal customer IDs.
- Routed every supply start through confirmed-only canonical activation.
- Retained missing-meter-value periods as blocked underlays and made readiness
  compare exact tenant/customer/contract/meter/period identities.
- Replaced monthly legacy export with canonical invoice export items and an
  atomic run/item/invoice-mirror reservation.
- Added full portal invoice traceability, lazy admin chain tracing, OpenAPI and
  deploy/rollback documentation.
- Verified typecheck, lint, API docs, migration checksums, 40 contract tests
  and 18 fixed-area tests. Focused identity/supply/billing tests pass 49/54;
  five old fixtures omit required exact identities.
