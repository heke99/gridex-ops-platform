# Session log

## 2026-07-25

- Read the master requirements and required repository context.
- Installed permanent project memory and Cursor operating rules.
- Compared local API/docs with the live developer page.
- Implemented all enumerated P0 and P1 repository fixes.
- Added forward-only billing/supply activation migration and manifest checksum.
- Added resolver, public DTO, invoice, interval, cron, activation, quote-schema
  and switch-state regressions.
- Fixed anonymous auth logging so tenantless 401 requests do not wait on the
  integration database.
- Verified typecheck, 346 tests, API docs/parity, migration history, lint and
  production build.
- Confirmed database apply verification is blocked by the absent Supabase
  runtime; recorded the exact staging continuation.
