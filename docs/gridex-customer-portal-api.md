# Gridex Customer Portal API

Current contract: **2026-08-22.2**

Use the canonical developer guide at `/developers/customer-portal-api#customer-portal` and the OpenAPI specification at `/api/v1/openapi/customer-portal-v1.json`.

Customer portal access is server-to-server. Gridex resolves the organization from the API credential and limits customer data to the verified linked customer identity. Internal database identifiers are not part of the public integration contract.

Draft branch checkpoint: customer-delegated `/api/v1/customer/*` reads and writes
require a second header, `x-gridex-customer-assertion`, issued by a platform-pinned
identity provider for the exact method and path. The token must carry the active
subject, tenant, API client and customer relation; an API key and a customer
number alone do not authorize an end user. If no issuer and subject binding
has been configured by the platform, these routes deny access. The tenant
machine `POST /api/v1/customer/sync` has a separate, exact
`customer_sync.write` scope. This draft change has not yet been published as a
new immutable OpenAPI release or configured for a real integration.
