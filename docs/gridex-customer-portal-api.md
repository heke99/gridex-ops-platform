# Gridex Customer Portal API

Current contract: **2026-09-29.1** (release candidate on the API draft branch)

Use the canonical developer guide at `/developers/customer-portal-api#customer-portal` and the OpenAPI specification at `/api/v1/openapi/customer-portal-v1.json`.

Customer portal access is server-to-server. Gridex resolves the organization from the API credential and limits customer data to the verified linked customer identity. Internal database identifiers are not part of the public integration contract.

Customer-delegated `/api/v1/customer/*` reads and writes (except tenant-machine
`POST /api/v1/customer/sync`)
require a second header, `x-gridex-customer-assertion`, issued by a platform-pinned
identity provider for the exact method and path. The token must carry the active
subject, tenant, API client and customer relation; an API key and a customer
number alone do not authorize an end user. If no issuer and subject binding
has been configured by the platform, these routes deny access. The tenant
machine `POST /api/v1/customer/sync` has a separate, exact
`customer_sync.write` scope. No real issuer or customer binding is configured by
this candidate. A tenant integration needs platform-managed enrollment before
delegated requests can succeed.

## Contact update contract

Keep the machine key on the tenant backend. A separately issued RS256 customer
assertion must bind `iss`, `aud`, `sub`, `iat`, `exp`, `company_id`,
`api_client_id`, `customer_id` and `action` to the authenticated client,
currently active portal account, and exact `POST /api/v1/customer/profile-update`
path. It expires within five minutes. A customer number, email or API key alone
does not prove the customer's identity. Assertions are not one-time tokens and
do not authorize login, billing-recipient or legal identity changes.

First read `GET /api/v1/customer/me` with a fresh assertion for that exact
action and the `customer_profile.read` scope. Use `data.contact_revision` from
the response. The contact-only POST requires `customer_contact.write`, a new
`Idempotency-Key` and `expected_contact_revision` with either `profile.email`
or `profile.phone` (or both). No other profile or facility field may accompany
the contact change. A stale revision returns 409 `contact_revision_conflict`;
the same key with a different change returns 409
`contact_idempotency_conflict`. Reusing the same key and payload returns the
stored completion and revision without another contact mutation, after current
client and customer authority is checked again. The completed command persists
the customer/contact projection, revision, audit, completion and internal
outbox in one local database transaction. It does not synchronously deliver an
external message. `data.status` is `accepted`, and
`data.completion_reference` is an opaque public reference.

Other profile fields currently use `customer_contact.write`; facility address
changes use `customer_facility_data.write`. Send them in separate POST requests.
These legacy writers do not have the contact command's atomic audit/outbox and
replay guarantee. The machine sync rejects `profile.phone`; its other profile,
document, legal and facility writers also remain separately staged. Do not
infer the contact guarantee for these paths. See
`scripts/tenantservice/customer-api-reference.mjs` for a runnable synthetic
contact journey using an isolated in-memory issuer and customer.
